# Macro

(Currently in Development)
This is a simple C++ terminal-only macro recorder and player.
This is my first ever programming project on Github so please be kind. Although I would request you to provide suggestions on how to improve it anyway.

### Prerequisites

* Works only on X window managers

### Dependencies for compiling manually

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev
```

### Compilation command

* Navigate to directory of main.cpp first
```
g++ main.cpp -o main -lX11 && ./main
```
